    <p>WoodStock 1999 was the second attempt to emulate the original WoodStock festival of 1969.
    WoodStock '99 was held in upstate Rome, New York and had an attendance of approximately 400,000 over four days.
    In addition, MTV had live coverage of the entire weekend which was available to watch on pay-per-view for
    people at home to watch. WoodStock '99 has become highly controversial due to environmental conditions,
    violence, sexual assault, allegations of rape, looting, vandalism, and arson.
    <br><br>
    The environment of WoodStock '99 was filled with heat around 100 degrees F with little to no shade due to the
      fact that the venue was a former air stip. In addition, festival goers were met with highly priced food and water and insufficient
      accommodations for camping and restrooms.
    <br><br>
    During the festival, violence broke out in the crowds during performances. Vandalism, sexual assaults, rape, and fires broke out
    during performances by Red Hot Chile Peppers, Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Creed, and more. MTV host Kurt Loder described the scene as:

  <br><br>"It was dangerous to be around. The whole scene was scary. There were just waves of hatred bouncing around the place, (...) It was clear we had to get out of there.... It was like a concentration camp. To get in, you get frisked to make sure you're not bringing in any water or food that would prevent you from buying from their outrageously priced booths. You wallow around in garbage and human waste. There was a palpable mood of anger."

    <br><br>Today, WoodStock '99 is infamous for a good idea gone terribly wrong and stands as a reminder for future festivals, how negligent
    hosts can be detrimental to a good time
