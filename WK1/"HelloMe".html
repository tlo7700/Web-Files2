      <!---Goals For Semester---->
      <h2>Goals for the semester:</h2>
      <p>I want to first learn how to create a simple website through html and css, with the end goal to have the knowledge to build my own complex websites for my own personal portfolios. This is because even though I find programs like squarespace really helpful, I want to know how to develop my own websites. </p>
