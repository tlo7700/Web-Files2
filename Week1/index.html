        <p>I am a senior at CU Boulder. I love graphic design and listening/playing music. In my spare time I like to go snowboarding, spend time with my dog, spend time with friends, and enjoy the beautiful Colorado outdoors. :) </p>

        <!---Goals For Semester---->
        <h2>Goals for the semester:</h2>
        <p>I want to first learn how to create a simple website through html and css, with the end goal to have the knowledge to build my own complex websites for my own personal portfolios. This is because even though I find programs like squarespace really helpful, I want to know how to develop my own websites. </p>
