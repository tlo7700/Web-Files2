      <div class="to-grasp-a-better-un-lMJovW roboto-normal-white-18px">
        To grasp a better understanding of the scope of this project, I identified three distinct sections of my app:
        Login/New User, Home Page, and Checkout Page. I found that planning out the task flow early on helped me make
        more strategic design decisions as I could identify opportunity areas and ask users to perform a specific task
        during user testing sessions.

        interactions a user takes. Below is a quick demo of the 3 main features.

          This was my first experience with the UX Design process and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I definitely
          underestimated how much work goes into creating apps. As I began to build out the final design I found myself
          wanting to learn more and make it as polished as possible. Although my app is currently lacking a lot of
          aspects, I think that it was a good representation on what the possibilites are with this app.

          interviews and getting more feedback on my design.
